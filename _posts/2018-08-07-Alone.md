Alone<br />
When everything's gone<br />
I don't know how<br />
It can be done<br />
I wanna throw<br />
A(but) this poem<br />

God<br />
Help me<br />
Guide me<br />
So I depraven't<br />
Aid me<br />
Guard me<br />
So I alonen't<br />

The clock ticking<br />
Second running<br />
Time flying<br />
I do nothing<br />

Tis but a mess<br />
What isn't one?<br />

<br />
<br />
