<span class="spoiler">I was walking down the street with my niggas Asnee, Scoopnum, Ratnum, and Oosna. We're going to school.<br>
In the way there, I remember what my teacher said to me "2 plus 2 is 4,<br>
Minus 1 that's 3, quick maths"</span>

<span class="spoiler">We're joking and smoking weed, high af.<br>
Scoopnum said to Asnee "I See your girl in the park, that girl is a uckers."<br>
Asnee respond to him "wtf bro! You don't say that to my girl!"<br>
Scoopnum continued "Your girl said to me 'When the ting went quack-quack-quack, you man were ducking' she's mocking me"</span>

<span class="spoiler">Ratnum calmed Asnee down  "Hold tight Asnee, he's got the pumpy"<br>
And also Oosna "Hold tight my man, he's got the frisbee"<br>
While I just mumbling "I trap, trap, trap on the road, movin' that cornflakes" cuz I high af.<br>
But Asnee still emotional "Rice Krispie, hold tight my girl Whitney"<br>
Fuck my nigga, I don't give a shit 'bout their problem. So I keep rappin "On the road doin' ten tours, allow my toes<br>
You man thought I froze<br>
I see a peng girl then I pose<br>
If she's not on it, I ghost"</span>

<span class="spoiler">Scoopnum raised his hand "Hah, look at your nose"<br>
Asnee pushing Scoopnum  "What? You dickhead!"<br>
"Look at your nose! Nose run like garden hose, shhh, you get me?" Scoopnum taunting.<br>
Boom, Asnee punched Scoopnum right in his face.<br>
Asnee said "You dun know, I see you shiverin' and that. Don't get shook man's here, you protected-ed, yeah?"</span>

<span class="spoiler">"Yeah, I protected. My dad was a police I'll call him right now" Scoopnum taking his cell phone.<br>
"My dad will hop out the four door with the .44 it was 1, 2, 3 and 4"</span>

<span class="spoiler">"Chillin' in the corridor, your dad is 44<br>
And he's still callin' man for a draw<br>
Let him know, when I see him, I'm gonna spin his jaw" Asnee seems not terrified.</span>

<span class="spoiler">"Your girl knows I've got the sauce, no ketchup. Just sauce, raw sauce" Scoopnum said to Asnee.</span>

<span class="spoiler">Boom!<br>
Something hit the ground, I think it is a UFO. The alien comes out.The ting goes skrrrahh!</span>

<span class="spoiler">Dat alien screaming towards us "Pap, pap, ka-ka-ka!"<br>
My legs trembling, i don't know what to say. So I scream back to it "Skidiki-pap-pap?"<br>
My niggas added "And a pu-pu-drrrr-boom!"<br>
And also Asnee "Skya!"<br>
The alien answer to us "Du-du-ku-ku-pun-pun!"<br>
Poom, poom! I shoot the alien with my gun,   headshot! The alien just die right away.<br>
"You dun know, Big Shaq" I said to the alien.<br>
"Ha, yo, yeah-yeah" the alien answer with the last power it had.</span>

<span class="spoiler">My action attracted the attention of the girls.<br>
So i said to them "You get me, man's not hot"<br>
I tell her "man's not hot, hah, cot"<br>
I tell her "man's not hot"<br>
The girl told me "take off your jacket"<br>
I said "babes, man's not hot"<br>
Yo, man can never be hot<br>
Perspiration ting, Lynx effect</span>
