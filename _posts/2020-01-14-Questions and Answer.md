**Questions** <br>
Why human tend to survive? <br>
Why all living things tend to keep their existence? <br>
Why time moved forward? <br>
What if time moved backwards? <br>

**Answer:**<br>
1. I found the answer to question #1 ont [this site](https://philosophy.stackexchange.com/questions/15596/why-is-it-necessary-to-survive?newreg=c3f02f22f46c48e28ef6379ba6438177)
On a question 'Why is it necesaary to survive?'

This is the most satisfiying answer: <br>
```
I think I am a kind of the "opposite" of you-(grin :)-I am a biologist who in the pursuit of the great questions of Life had to introduce himself to philosophy, so I have my own unique perspective on this question and can understand how you "feel" about it!

If you ask my colleagues they will probably start to mumble things like it is evolution driving Life so it needs to survive to evolve, it is a "natural instinct" or even survival is the purpose of Life but as a man who had "been" in both worlds-philosophy and biology I want to tell you some personal experience-neither the biologists. not the philosophers can answer you arguably good. I think the reason is biologists don't understand philosophy and philosophers-biology. And what is even worse is they sometimes do not want to understand each other! But in order to answer your question-they simple must! This is why you get the attitude you get. If you ask a philosopher he will tell you survival is a matter of choice and start citing existentialism or psychoanalysis or any other "big" school of philosophy and try to defend his or hers perspective behind the names of "great authors" in the respective school. It is how philosophers think! If you ask my colleagues they will think like scientists-they tell you Life is what we observe to be Life! Therefore any facts about Life are facts about our observations. We observe Life trying to survive, therefore survival is a prerequisite of Life. All things alive try to survive-therefore, survival is part of Life! Of course, there are some "exceptions" here and there but even they can be explained in terms of the individual dying for the sake of the group or any other "superorganism" they can observe. Do you agree? And it is here where the "conflict" comes into play and it seems like everybody has their own answer for the question but what they really are doing is like comparing their own "version" of reality to anyone else's? Have you ever been in such a situation?

I have and the way I got out of it was to try to cross-reference what the different experts had in mind when talking about the same thing. I know it sounds easy, but the reality is sometimes understanding what the question is is the most difficult part of finding the answer! As far as survival is concerned I tried to look at the question itself, rather than at philosophy and biology in particular and asked myself the question-Is there a reason Life is actively trying to spread? I know it may not sound like your question at first, but think about it for a second what spreadmay infer? It can be a spread in space which means growth and/or reproduction and a spread in time which may be evolution for the group and survival for the individual. Does now this question bear in mind? Then, why is Life trying to spread?

May be, because it itself is a SELF-sustaining process!(Please, pay attention to the noun self here.)This is the answer Igot a long time ago(actually, it wasn't so long in calendar time, but for me it seemed like it was an eternity ago :). How about it?

Oxidation is a self-sustaining process, especially if the heat produced by the oxidation itself can produce more heat to power the production for even more heat. There is a layman's term for such chemical reaction-it is called fire! Just like fire Life is a self-sustaining process. The difference is Life is self-contained withinits own borders(please, consider the concept of the autopoiesis for more details). Once you start a fire does it want to stop? When will a fire stop-when youwant it to stop or when it had consumed all the available resources? Does a fire stops on "its own will"? Does a fire wantsto stop? What is its desire?

P.S.I hope this helps :)

Life is compared to fire, because it is self-sustaining process just like it. The big difference, however, is Life keeps the energy it releases withinitself to build more organization with it, while fire releases it in the environment. In short fire simplifies its environment-Life complexifies it. If fire could generate complexity it would be truly alive. But it doesn't. However it displays the answer to the question asked here-it displays "the will" to survive as any self-sustaining process does. If Life is self-sustaining process, then its desire to survive is explained. â€“ Yordan YordanovFeb 26 '17 at 23:11

2. An answer 'for why time is moving forward?'
by Me on 25/01/2020 <br>
```
Mengapa waktu bergerak ke depan?<br>
Karena waktu, kemanapun geraknya, hasilnya akan tetap sama.<br>
Manusia tumbuh dari bayi menjadi tua karena waktu berjalan ke depan.<br>
Manusia tumbuh dari bayi yang tidak bisa mengingat sesuatu menjadi orang tua yang pikun dan mudah lupa.<br>
Manusia berawal dari ketiadaan menuju ketiadaan.<br>
Sekarang bagaimana jika waktu berjalan mundur?<br>
Manusia akan berbalik dari kematian (ketiadaan) dan menjadi semakin muda menjadi bayi yang setelah itu akan menjadi tiada.<br>
Manusia akan berbalik dari pikun menjadi tidak bisa mengingat.<br>
Bukankah sama saja?<br>
Seorang pelajar yang awalnya tidak tahu, setelah belajar menjadi tahu, keesokan harinya lupa. Bagaimana jika waktu berjalan mundur?<br>
Tinggal dibalik. Pelajar yang sekarang lupa, kemudian jadi tahu, keesokan harinya tidak tahu.<br>
Apa bedanya?<br>
